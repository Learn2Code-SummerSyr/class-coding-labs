Databases are build using columns and rows, just like and excel file. The other great thing about databases is they persist.

    "First, we will need to model our data. Data modeling gives us the opportunity to think through our data and develop a schema for our database. This approach takes much less time then recreating a new database everytime you realize you need to add a new column to your table. It also allows you to think through complex relationships and how to build your database to best represent them. Data modeling can be a sophisticated problem, for our use case we will keep it simple. If you want a quick lesson on data modeling [check this out](http://www.agiledata.org/essays/dataModeling101.html)\n",

    "\n",
    "First step in modeling data is breaking your data entity into separate properties. Databases require you to define the type of data that it is storing in each column. So for our favs, we would need to have some sort of identifier, the title of the song, and the artist. Each property needs to be assigned a type. For example\n",
